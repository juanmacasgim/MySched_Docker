Hello everyone, this is the Docker project for MySched.

MySched is a personal project created for my higher education studies. This application is a calendar: I developed the frontend using React with TypeScript, the backend using Laravel, and the database with MySQL.

To test the application, you need to have Docker Desktop installed. Then, open a terminal window and run the following command:
- docker-compose build

This process may take a while. Once it finishes, run the next command:
- docker-compose up

Finally, you can view the application in your web browser. Open your preferred browser and go to http://localhost. If everything started correctly, you should see the web app.
